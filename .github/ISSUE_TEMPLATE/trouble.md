* [ ] This post does not contain any proprietary or confidential information. All information shared here is publicly visible.
* [ ] For any problem you identify, post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) so the maintainer can troubleshoot. A reproducible example is:
    * [ ] **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    * [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    * [ ] **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
